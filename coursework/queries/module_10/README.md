# LCC CS276 Final Project
This directory contains the code for my submission for the final project. The [FinalProjectDb.sql](./FinalProjectDb.sql) represents the true "final" code, and contains all definitions and insertions required to initialize the database. The [functions](./functions/), [procedures](./procedures/), and [triggers](./triggers/) directories all contain testbeds for the individual program units, which will include any unit tests made during development
